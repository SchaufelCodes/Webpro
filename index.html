                    <h5>The Problem?</h5>
                    <p>The problem: Password security.
                        Most people use the same password for every site they use. We do this so it is easy to remember our login credentials.  This is the easiest and riskiest way. If someone acquire one  password they could abuse it in multiple sites. They can use it for identity theft or acquire information that you wouldn’t want anyone else to know.

                    <h5>Solution: The keyrig.</h5>
                    <p>The Keyrig is a device that gives you the option to store login credentials relative to the sites that you use. When you login to the Keyrig you can directly go to all your sites without logging in to each individual site. You can also use the Keyrig on other computers.</p>

                    <h5>Security</h5>
                    <p>The Keyrig is encrypted and is activated with a fingerprint scanner and/or a single master password, which makes it impossible to use by other people. To protect your stored passwords data is automatically deleted if the password has been mistyped too many times.
